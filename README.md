# Mini-Computer-Store
This is a mini computer store that demonstrates some of my SQL knowledge
It offers a MVC design pattern and interacted with a database hosted at our school. That database no longer exists, nor did I want to give it out, but it currently has the code to run outside of that.
It's not necessarily a finished product as there are many more searches and interactions possible, but it demonstrates an understanding of Java's statement class and SQL interactions.
